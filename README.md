# Memory Match Game

## Description
Memory Match Game is a web-based game designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It presents users with a grid of 20 images arranged in a 5x4 layout. Each image is repeated twice. The game begins with all images visible for 3 seconds, allowing players to memorize their positions. After this brief period, the images are flipped, and players must select pairs of images. Matching pairs earn rewards, while non-matching pairs incur penalties.
