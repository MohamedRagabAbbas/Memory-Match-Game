# Memory-Match-Game
Memory-Match-Game presents users with a grid of 20 images arranged in a 5x4 layout. Each image is repeated twice. The game begins with all images visible for 3 seconds, allowing players to memorize their positions. After this brief period, the images are flipped, and players must select pairs of images.
